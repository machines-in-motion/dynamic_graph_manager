 *   - [3] Spawn the first real time process that executes the following:
 *      - [3.1] gets  the  sensor  data  using Drivers and  saves  them  in  the
 *              shared std::map sensors

 *
 * In this class we heavily depend on std::unique pointers in order to
 * initialize the DynamicGraph process and the hardware communication process
